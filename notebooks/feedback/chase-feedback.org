acer sent me this; very very very neat idea
9:57 PM
9:57 PM
Oh, hell yeah! I've been obsessing over this system called Laws of Form for the last couple years
9:58 PM
9:58 PM
Is that book where this comes from

** Chase
This is very interesting to me; this topic seems like a rather succinct description of human advantage & LLM deficiency (human spatial representation generalizes to highly abstract visual rule systems, and does so well)
And at the same time these ideas were made in the absence of any LLM/VLM to critique

I agree
I realized just recently that I could actually possibly get into a big AI lab with this
10:04 PM

** Chase
10:04 PM
So they just identified all this from first principles
#Walerie
: I agree
Oh yeah, you'd be surprised how much contact I've had with labs over my extremely simplistic VPCT
If you can come up with a lot of these ideas/enumerate them in RL envs, I think many labs would be interested
esp. google/openai
10:05 PM

** Val
Yes, even deeper first principles actually

The central concept is "distinction", which is at the root of all concepts. Laws of Form goes into detail, but tldr; you require "distinction" in order to create any concept; and distinction itself is a self-referential definition and also a triple-action: the drawing of a boundary; the assigning of a value; the labeling of a name
So unlike most formal systems which perform axiomatics, this system is based purely on the concept of how the very first inklings of meaning comes into being
But that's getting quite philosophical

the point is, this is a very foundational concept and extremely simple formal system and can be depicted in many ways because of its foundational & simple nature
it is morphic to boolean algebra, and extensions to this system are morphic to other logical systems like modal logic or paraconsistent logic

I just got started on making an eval suite for this system, and I'm wondering what further steps I need to take to iterate on what I have atm
10:08 PM
10:08 PM
And also if you want to explore this idea too, I'm more than happy to talk about it :P

I know that there are a lot of variations to be made; a combinatorial explosion tbqh that I doubt that all expressions of this can be fully fine tuned
** Chase
In my mind the general process for evals is:
1) design eval
2) create data for eval
3) de-bias (ensure labels are equal, i.e. same amount of void and circle on the first problem I sent)
4) sample models, evaluate performance (+metadata like cost/token usage/latency, if you want)
5) analyze model responses and draw qualitative conclusions
6) [optional] organize the above into a paper
7) publish results

well my fundamentals here are somewhat embarrassingly primitive; i know a bit about boolean algebra and propositional and first order logic from some of my cs master's courses

but I am very interested in the subject, if there are any materials you recommend I would try to read them
10:13 PM

The answer is ~50/50 with random guess (technically not, for reasons), so I felt it was necessary to constrain the output to require intermediary steps, but that just resulted in me giving the models a lot of scaffolding in order to make that work

Here's a video walkthrough of the original book

** Chase
i think my knowledge representation course is about the deepest I ever got into logic, had first-order logic, propositional logic, but mostly focused on programming formalizations of those

** Val
I don't think people need advanced logic to appreciate what this system is
When I first encountered it I was actually surprised at how simple it was for its supposed seminal influence on something I wanted to learn called "second order cybernetics"

I thought it was so simple that it was stupid

IDK if you want to learn the system itself or read discussion about its significance

This one is a fable-retelling of the formal system without reference to logic

This is a fairly dense philosophy of math / programming / electrical engineering essay about laws of form
But if you find it difficult, well, you know where to find me :p

I've been obsessing over it for the last 2.5-3 years honestly
There's been some significant things done with it by William Bricken in particular

in the 80s he tried to make a startup that used it for the purpose of semiconductor optimization

because the Circle you see there is actually a NOR gate
10:23 PM

** Chase
well funnily enough AI is becoming central for semiconductor optimization (particularly EUV patterning) 45 years later
10:25 PM

** Val
Bricken is getting quite old
I hope I can carry on his legacy
I want to see his work through

How did you get started with publicizing your work with VPCT? I definitely need to start posting more about this one

the name should have something to do with "distinction", hmmm
10:27 PM

** Chase
I think I just posted on my twitter and that was it lol
i kept posting new results for each model that came out and it just gained traction on its own

people love seeing the slop graphs with numbers going up
i've been somewhat distant from academia for a bit, but if I was still involved I would have written papers instead of just posting model results
in fact I sometimes consider writing a paper about it

Gemini 3 Pro (preview) scores 91% on VPCT (spatial reasoning)

Uhhhh jesus christ
Media content
my most recent model results got 1700 likes and 250k views
how you want to publicize depends on what you want, though
if you want impact/views, spend some time having claude and chatgpt make you different graphics until you find something that looks nice
if you want to affect research at a sincere level, communicate with labs or publish a paper

** Val
Hmm

I also saw Victor Taelin realize that he just needs to make a benchmark

I don't understand linear combinators like he does but maybe I should reach out since this is already adjacent
10:35 PM

** Chase
i love victor taelin's stuff
i think his fixation is everything lambda calc
10:36 PM

Linear Combinators as well, which I really want to research eventually

James Algebra and linear combinators are soooo similar I swear there is something super elegant that bridges between the two
And then we'd really be cooking

I need to slide into this Anthropic guy's DMs hmmm

I think you should give it a try as well

I'm curious how much help you scaffold models with when you perform benchmarks

I have a standard system and user prompt that i use for all models, it's public
I will say I found strangely that this prompt improves performance (which I did not expect)
"You are an expert physics simulator. Looking at this image of a ball-and-bucket physics simulation, predict which bucket (numbered 1, 2, or 3 from left to right) the ball will eventually fall into.

Let's think about this step by step:

1. First, observe the initial position of the ball
2. Note any obstacles or lines drawn that will affect the ball's path
3. Consider how gravity will affect the ball's trajectory
4. Think about how the ball will bounce and roll along the surfaces
5. Analyze how the placement and angle of each line will guide the ball
6. Factor in that the ball has some elasticity and will bounce slightly when it hits surfaces

Based on your analysis, please conclude with a clear answer in this format: 'answer(X)' where X is the bucket number (1, 2, or 3).

Explain your reasoning, then end with your answer in the specified format."
This is given to all models
It was generated by claude 3.5 sonnet (new), and interestingly results in substantially improved performance for all models
despite ostensibly not contributing much
10:45 PM

** Val
And you're only measuring the end result, eh

The problem with my test is that it's a 50/50 on random guess, and I also want to track intermediate steps to categorize types of errors
There's a lot of "correct" answers that have totally bunk reasoning
10:47 PM
So I'm not sure if I just live with it and only declare 95%+ performance as actually good and cap the floor to 50%

** Chase
yeah VPCT has a similar problem
one thing you can do is composite results
so for example, instead of just posing a 50/50 circle vs void problem; you have an image with like 8 problems and you add the number of circles results, say
then you're only "correct" if you get all 8 right, reducing random guess's influence

** Val
In the same context, eh?

** Chase
well current models (including gemini 3 pro) are extremely extremely bad at visual/spatial reasoning
in METR terms I'd give most models ~0.1-0.3 seconds time horizon in vision
GPT-5 and gemini 2.5 pro would get ~0.6 seconds
and gemini 3 pro would get closer to 1-3 seconds
what we currently are looking forward to is models that match 5-10 second horizons or slightly further

** Val
oh, also, I forgot to send you more visual examples (idk if acer already sent)

** Chase
i only got a bit from acer, i'd love more examples
10:53 PM

** Val
<a bunch more examples, like what I sent to SQCU>

I realized earlier today that any self-similar shape could also encode laws of form; so an example of sierpinski triangles could be an adversarial example

Chase Brower
then you're only "correct" if you get all 8 right, reducing random guess's influence
I think the intermediary step approach is too restricting, hand-holding, and not fruitful, so I think I'll go for this approach, thank you! :)

And maybe start making the first non-parens 2d tests as well

gemini performs surprisingly decently at images like these, although it does get the transcription somewhat incorrect (in a way that doesn't affect the final result, unfortunately >_>)
