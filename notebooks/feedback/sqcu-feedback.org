I'd love to ask for your thoughts on where I should go with this research direction because tbqh this excites me so much and I think I actually got something I can continue to pursue and use to learn and contribute to modern ML proper

<research statement for poseidon>

the basic idea is that LoF + family are interesting formalisms to benchmark with that is at the edge of training distribution; the simplest formal system that can be taught to humans in seconds but seems to feature significant difficulties for LLMs to perform with rudimentary 0-shot testing? (90% accuracy tanks to 30% with increasing depth and length and even "correct" categorizations often include incorrect reasoning traces)
Pretty rough and incredibly basic atm, and I'm still worrying or doubting myself on whether or not this is an interesting avenue of research (or... subject to use as means of interpretability studies?)

Okay I shall
Last few days I have been literally. Literally. Blowing off ml to try to play fonv again and it didn't stick
Last night I got a vllm style masking based complex batch size or complex sequence tensor shape attention kernel working
And was running models through distillation training (make k sampling steps match j<k sampling steps) from very early in random init

consider this term rewriting rule, it's as simple as can be:

when i clap my hands two times (👏👏.), the terms separated by the '👏:' operator go from left to right.

(don't worry about problems like striding and overlap, the '.' denotes a sequence breaking pause.)

here's an example:

great big very 👏: small.
"a great big very problem appears for us."
=> 👏👏.
=> small 👏: small.
"a small problem appears for us."

the astute reader will notice that 👏-rewriting is so brutally simple that it does not have scoping rules. if you hit that clap rewriter, your terms are CLAPPED. there is no room for piddling about here.

okay now here we go:

width👏:letter1👏:m. height👏:letter2👏:n.
"a matrix has width 43123 and height 3."
=>👏👏.
=>
letter1👏:m👏:m. letter2👏:n👏:n.
"a matrix has letter1 43123 and letter2 3."
=> 👏👏.
=> 
m👏:m👏:m. n👏:n👏:n.
"a matrix has m 43123 and n 2."

now that we have established a formal bridge between ensembles of letters, ensembles of letters but the ensemble is different, and singular letters as used in the garish and incompetent notation of the elder clowns, we have learned a deep and powerful lesson.

emojis are really funny. no, uh.
term rewriting systems are really basic. no, uh.
people who use notations they do not like are disavowing and abnegating the literal tools of their formal systems, or perhaps expressing a preference for less rigor and more confusion.

oorrr...

👏AND :.👏:  🪤  .
👏AND : 👏: 📦.
AND 👏: {}.

one thing that i think is worth thinkn bout here is whether enclosure and containment problems can or should be measured through text token outputs *alone*. the *alone* part is key here: we should be really critical of ways to measure formalisms where we elect to use notations where randomly fuzzing the last k characters in a 1024 long string causes extreme oscillations in the parsed value of the entire output. this basically puts weird pressures on any kind of generator or parser, either of which could have soft errors, such that every single bit of output has cross interactions with every other bit of input... all the time... with no exceptions?

i think that this 'representation of representation' (what an annoying torque or twist to use that phrase) is fraught. it is also arbitrary and i'm not sure we should take it seriously.

why should little perturbations produce extremely spiky changes in the parsing of our 'A contains B, B contains zilch, C contains an A and an A and an A'? in this sense we might prefer to render all of our containment rules as a minimum of an 8x8 grid of ascii characters *such that* the symbol A can literally form a blobby ring shape wrapping around the literal symbol B. now if we have fuzzing of the boundaries of our A-enclosure, the extra spatial dimension means that we can still sensibly parse the A-contains-B as one of many enclosure-relation-equivariant projections of the terse symbolicization of that A-contains-B position.

I agree

I'm just using the ASCII version as most convenient for my get-something-measured-asap v1 notebook

But given the range of visual dialects and simplicity of containment there's actually a very very large space of representation rules that are semantically invariant

I'll have to send u a screenshot when I get back on my lappy

a dangerous distraction for me, the diffusion scripts im messing with right now were actually specified to try to implement image -> graph and graph -> image in-context-learning remappings
this is a problem class which is actually identical to 'how to retexture or remodel 3d assets to follow new constraints'
5:03 PM

oh yeah anyways what was i saying? aight. so the problem structure you're pointing at w/ the spencer brown axioms seems like a better (better than what? well, any other idea i've seen so far!) starting point for making didactic or teaching datasets for ML models to give them more exposure to term rewriting and formal systems which are geared towards making new operators. from my exposure to bourbaki, i gotta say, bourbaki *sucks*. it's primitive and its confusing and if you try to memorize it you'll lose mental capabilities faster than you gain them, with the 'prize' at the end of bourbaki being that you remember a bunch of silly idioms about squares and diamonds. if you'd even understood the metaphors in bourbaki, you would have started writing a better term rewriting system *formally equivalent* to bourbaki but more expressive and compact, and grounded your alternate idiom in reductions to and from bourbaki or an abstract term rewriting interlanguage which makes demonstrating functional equivalence faster.

its also worth asking, i think, whether anyone has actually started the project of making an arc-agi for symbolic or tokenizable topics. mister arc-agi himself couldn't think of any so he was forced to retreat to higher dimensional representations, which is very funny if we think about it tbqh.

I think the visual dialects and extremely simple nature of the concept (distinction / difference) makes it amenable to many many variations

it doesn't even have to be monochromatic, there's no reason not to perturb the representation of an eval to, say, have rainbow gradients if "containment is the only thing that matters"

i also believe there are many possible highly adversarial examples; LoF is expressable through any self-similar structure I believe

hmmm... thinking that one of the big problems with formal systems is that the people who wrote em up usually got caught in the problem of deciding what's worth expressing or encoding with their symbolics. usually they try to encode something like 'their own formal system' and 'all of the propositions and terms needed for their formal system', then sort of like, peter out and forget what to do next
one of the basic backstops for avoiding becoming underconstrained or confused is to make a roguelike parser and deserializer ('serialize' in an abstract sense, returning non-flat data structures anyone knows how to handle is equivalent), 3d model parser and deserializer, etc.

in a certain sense we probably discover the expressivity and use-value of a formal system when we find we can do compact representations of a poem and also a doom level within the symbolic register, and find ourselves making edits to the poem and the doom level alike using both the new symbolic dual and the 'flat' (again, in an abstract sense) structures it pairs with. weirdly i think this is one of those odd situations where the option of making language models (and similar programs) makes formalism easier and better since you aren't tasking yourself with making a generator that covers the range of your representational scheme at the same time you're putting the scheme together

** Val:

All the examples I've shown so far are on the "most abstract" scale of abstraction too, I was thinking that there should be many examples with much higher visual fidelity in which it would be useful and important for models to be capable of distinction, like with these wooden rings

<example: kindergarteners being taught laws of form with concentric wooden rings>
www.youtube.com/watch?v=aXLSNfPqArs

re: hmmm... thinking that one of the big problems in formal systems.....
axiomatics, yeah --- "we want to formalize a system in which ab != ba because reasons, so we need so and so axioms"

what's notable about LoF is that it emerged from an investigation into the nature of sign systems and the nature of the observer

distinction is at the heart of all concepts because one must distinguish in order to label and name, to assign a value, to draw a boundary
and distinction is self-referential

<example: the Room Dialect>
<example: the Path Dialect>
room dialect and path dialect provide /experiential/ encodings, and it has intrigued me very much

I can send you PDFs of Iconic Arithmetic vols 1-3 if you'd like
LoF is interpretable as boolean algebra;
but it is also its own thing too

James Algebra ~ constructible numbers
but also rhymes with linear combinators

IIRC there exist several other extensions to LoF like BF Calculus which maps to modal logic

and equations of the second order map to paraconsistent logic
Each their own thing still
and because the axioms are so simple, they're still trivially easy to extend and switch it up --- that'd keep the models on their toes

re: its also worth asking, i think, whether anyone has actually started the project of making an arc-agi for symbolic or tokenizable topics. mis
I do think it is quite funny as well
I was thinking for a while that this is the ur-arc-agi and surely someone must have mentioned it to him

It seems very possibly not!!

ganbarre! oh btw i found myself actually using topological / enclosure reasoning while solving a programming problem with gemini 3 today

like legit i wasable to say 'hey this config parser is doing something at the wrong enclosure level, please rewrite so that this config file is sensibly parseable' and. it. just. worked.
so the things you want to do with your testing and measurement framework are really appropriate questions for rl environment design, benchmark design, and problem corpora which modern models *can learn*. the part where models are eager to use these tools and methods is really exciting -- there are lots of research programs that would have been abstract philosophy 5 years ago but are now 'wacky subject matter expert engineer' stuff today!

Behold, the donuts are solvable

Grok summary:
#+begin_example
@sameQCU 's post showcases experimental results from custom diffusion models, where larger variants (512 hidden dimensions) outperform smaller ones in reconstructing shapes like donuts and checkerboards from noisy latents via image-to-image denoising, bypassing text prompts.
Accompanying visuals display side-by-side comparisons of ground truth images, noisy inputs, and model reconstructions, revealing enhanced recovery of textures and edges, particularly for high-frequency patterns like checkerboards across resolutions from 32x32 to 64x64.
This work builds on latent diffusion principles, empirically probing noise schedule impacts on spatial correlations—echoing findings in papers like "Denoising Diffusion Probabilistic Models" (Ho et al., 2020)—to inform scalable architecture searches in generative AI.

My brother brought up the idea of patenting this and I realized that oh shit, if I applied and were getting an offer through this, Anthropic would 100% require me to take it down and keep it secret 

Anthropic has heavy heavy NDAs 

Idk how to feel about that

Honestly just given the scale I imagine this would also be a source of a family of useful synthetic training datasets in addition to evals

And idk if I am comfortable with having that be a trade secret?

** SQCU
patents broadly are fake and you could never really prove someone did or didnt use a similar internal eval suite or get training gradients off of it or the opposite of it and so on
but yes everything is NDAed and you will not get to work on public projects once you're yoinked by a research lab
that's why i've been livepublishing code at reflex speed and trying to leak as much of my motivations and results as possible up until whatever point in time i'm forced to stop doing that
